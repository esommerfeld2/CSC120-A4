Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment.

- What are your initial impressions of how `Encapsulation` affects your programming?
I think that it makes coding in java make more sense. Before I was confused on organization and now I think I get it better. I do feel like some things were really repitative but maybe that was just the nature of this assignment. 

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
This homework went better than the last one, I think I had a better grasp on coding in java which definitely helped. I was confused when trying to run car.java because you needed to understand what was happening in passenger.java before you could run it. I think Thursday's class though helped with that concept and I was able to make everything run. I would say for someone taking this class in the future to try to work through engine and car before Thursday, but don't worry about testing car until after Thursdays class.
